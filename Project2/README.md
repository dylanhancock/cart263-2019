“Brain Detergent” is a project which explores the increasingly deceptive climate of the modern day internet. This project focuses on videos which prey upon younger audiences by presenting content as children oriented when in actuality are presenting sinister messages.

I wanted to make a program which does this, except instead of promoting sinister acts, “Brain Detergent” promotes the audience to destroy their computer entirely.

The interactive design centres around the idea of liking and disliking a video. Within youtube especially, a videos likes will often determine the longevity of the videos popularity, and the more popular they are, the more audiences they reach. I took this concept and flipped it by creating an interaction where if the user says “like” or clicks the like button the video degrades itself, revealing it’s true message over a number of likes. On the contrary, the dislike button produces pop up screens to introduce the idea that if you dislike the video something bad will happen. The only way to remove these icons is to like the video but upon removing the items, the video increases in sinisterity parallel to this cycle of likes and dislikes which all youtube videos are binded to.


I created the project in javascript using Jquery, Annyang, CSS, Javascript  and HTML. I customized each image to give it a unique and cohesive aesthetic feel and gave each object it’s own individual movement and interactive response using CSS animations and Jquery. The videos I created in after effects and used javascript to cinch the degrading effect together. I found the annyang element particularly challenging as my voice detector was failing due to the audio of the videos, but once I compressed the videos enough and found two words which were very distinct (“like”, “dislike”)  the program began working.

Once the code was down, I wanted to make sure I had a cohesive look to it because I feel like my other projects have been rather sporadic and untamed in terms of aesthetics. I went for an aesthetic which represents the evil side of the internet, I used inverted icons. pixelated them and tweaked the colours to give them all an evil look and feel.


Overall, I wish to continue to do video based projects within javascript because I feel like the possibilities are endless with interaction. I cannot wait to begin the final project and expand on these ideas.
